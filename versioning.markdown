# Versioning

In this chapter we examine operations to add and remove to and from the repository and how to stage, commit these changes.

### Staging Area

Git tracks each file in the working tree for changes. Before you commit, you must stage a set of changes to the staging area. Only changes in the staging area can be committed.
(This staging area is sometimes called the index or the cache.)

Once an already staged file changes, you need to re-stage it.

``` bash
$ git init .
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/czigolag/git/.git/

czigolag@yldnw0400173clu ~/git
$ touch .gitignore

czigolag@yldnw0400173clu ~/git
$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#       .gitignore
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

czigolag@yldnw0400173clu ~/git
$ git add --all

czigolag@yldnw0400173clu ~/git
$ echo "*~" >> .gitignore

czigolag@yldnw0400173clu ~/git
$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
#
#       new file:   .gitignore
#
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#       modified:   .gitignore
#
```

You can (re-)add and remove files from the staging area at any time. The staging area captures each file in the state it was staged.

If git encounters a *.gitignore*, it will apply its contents to ignore files/directories matching the provided patterns. These rules apply from the directory they are defined in. Example:

```
# a comment - this is ignored
# no .a files
*.a
# but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
!lib.a
# only ignore the root TODO file, not subdir/TODO
/TODO
# ignore all files in the build/ directory
build/
# ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
doc/*.txt
# ignore all .txt files in the doc/ directory
doc/**/*.txt
```

Git limitation: git can't track empty directories. Convention is to add an empty file named *empty* or *.gitignore*. In fact, Git does not track directories at all, it only tracks files, creating the directory structures based on their paths.

You can use *gir rm* and *git mv* to remove and move files. Git tracks moves implicitely.

### Commit

You can commit what you have staged. To see what youâ€™ve changed but not yet staged, type *git diff*. To compare the staging area the last commit, you can use *git diff --staged*.

You can commit staged files any time. **Check to be on the correct branch before committing.**

```bash
$ git commit -m "Initialize repository."
[master 536f407] Initialize repository.
 1 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)
 delete mode 100644 .gitignore
```

If not yet pushed, you can amend (modify) previous commits with --amend.

If you wish to commit all your changes as-is, you can use the -a flag with commit to stage all current changes beforehand.

As a result of a commit the object database (.git/objects) may contains four types of objects:

* A blob object is the content of a file. Blob objects have no file name, time stamps, or other metadata.
* A tree object is the equivalent of a directory (structure). It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and the name of a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory's contents. This object describes a snapshot of the source tree.
* A commit object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.
* Branch and tag objects are a references to a particular commit and some additional meta-data. Once created, tags do not change.
* HEAD-s are symbolic references to the latest state of branches, or in special cases a specific commit without a branch ("detached head.")

### Fetch and Push.

Fetch and push are the mechanism by which means remote git repositories synchronize. That is, when you execute *git fetch (...)* the
