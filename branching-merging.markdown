# Branch Structure

Git has a lightweight and useful branching concept. Git has internally (.git/refs/heads) a table of branch names with the corresponding HEAD pointing to the latest commit of the branch. (A branch also consist of each preceding commit object of its HEAD and each and every corresponding tree and blob object.)
